        About Me: 
                My favorite game right now would a A Hat in Time.It's a 3d platformer that is actually good. The whole game has an overwhleming amount of Charm put into it. And has some cool moments. Like getting stabbed by a train conductor or selling your soul and becoming a contract worker 
                and stopping said train conductor from blowing up the train with people in it.
